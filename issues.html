            <p>Air Pollution: This type of pollution involves the release of harmful substances into the Earth's atmosphere. Common air pollutants include carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and particulate matter (PM). Sources of air pollution include vehicle emissions, industrial processes, and the burning of fossil fuels. Air pollution can lead to respiratory diseases, environmental damage, and climate change.

            <p>Water Pollution: Water pollution occurs when contaminants are introduced into water bodies such as rivers, lakes, oceans, and groundwater. Sources of water pollution include industrial discharges, agricultural runoff, sewage, and oil spills. Water pollution can harm aquatic ecosystems, make water unsafe for drinking and recreation, and endanger aquatic life.

            <p>Plastic Pollution: Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic waste in the environment, particularly in oceans and waterways. It is a consequence of inadequate plastic waste management and the persistence of plastics in the environment. Plastic pollution harms marine life, disrupts ecosystems, and can enter the food chain, posing health risks to humans.</p>

            <p>Litter Pollution: Litter pollution involves the careless disposal of trash and waste materials in public spaces. It degrades the visual quality of the environment, can be harmful to wildlife that ingest or become entangled in litter, and can lead to soil and water pollution.</p>
