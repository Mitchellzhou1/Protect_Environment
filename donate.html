            <p>Clean Up the World was established in 1993 and is one of the largest
community-based environmental programs in the world.

We unite community groups, schools, businesses, and local governments to carry out activities that address local environmental issues.  We provide expertise, support and guidance to members in 130 countries across the world. 

Our vision is to inspire all people across all continents to tread lightly, clean up and conserve the planet.

Join us a global effort to combat waste and plastic pollution. 
You can register a Clean Up the World activity at any time of the year here. 

Or join us for Clean Up the World Weekend on the third weekend in September.
